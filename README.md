# EDA, Lookalike, and Clustering Project

## Project Overview:
This repository contains the analysis of a dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike analysis, and Clustering techniques.

## Files:
- `Mrunmai_Kashyape_EDA.pdf`: PDF report for Exploratory Data Analysis.
- `Mrunmai_Kashyape_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the EDA code.
- `Mrunmai_Kashyape_Lookalike.csv`: Dataset for Lookalike analysis.
- `Mrunmai_Kashyape_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Lookalike analysis.
- `Mrunmai_Kashyape_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report for Clustering analysis.
- `Mrunmai_Kashyape_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Clustering code.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/EDA_Clustering_Project.git`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks using `jupyter notebook` command.
3. Run the notebooks to reproduce the analysis.
